## HTTP Requests
> An example POST request. Note that customer_product_history_id, created_at, modified_at and created_by are all handled internally by the system and need not be explicitly specified. See Meta Data for more information.

```python
    url = "http://smartapi.bboxx.co.uk/v1/customer_product_histories"
    data = json.dumps({
        "k1": "v1",
        "k2": "v2"
    })
    headers = {'Content-Type': 'application/json', 'Authorization': 'Token token=' + <valid_token>}

    r = requests.post(url=url, data=data, headers=headers)

    r
    >>> <Response 201>

    r.json()

    >>> {
        "k1": "v1",
        "k2": "v2"
    }
```

> We can retrieve the `customer_product_history` created by specifying its `customer_product_history_id` in the request url:

```python
    url = 'http://smartapi.bboxx.co.uk/v1/customer_product_histories/1'
    headers = {'Content-Type': 'application/json', 'Authorization': 'Token token=' + <valid_token>}

    r = requests.get(url=url, headers=headers)

    r
    >>> <Response 200>

    r.json()
    >>> {
        "k1": "v1",
        "k2": "v2"
    }
```

> and we can retrieve all customer_product_histories by omitted the customer_product_history_id:

```python
    url = 'http://smartapi.bboxx.co.uk/v1/customer_product_histories'
    headers = {'Content-Type': 'application/json', 'Authorization': 'Token token=' + <valid_token>}

    r = requests.get(url=url, headers=headers)

    r
    >>> <Response 200>

    r.json()
    >>> {
        "k1": "v1",
        "k2": "v2"
    }
```

> We can edit the newly created customer_product_history with a `PUT` request:

```python
    url = 'http://smartapi.bboxx.co.uk/v1/customer_product_histories'
    data = json.dumps({
        "k1": "v1",
        "k2": "v2"
    })
    headers = {'Content-Type': 'application/json', 'Authorization': 'Token token=' + <valid_token>}

    r = requests.post(url=url, data=data, headers=headers)

    r
    >>> <Response 200>

    r.json()
    >>> {
        "k1": "v1",
        "k2": "v2"
    }
```
> Note that the `modified_at` field has been updated accordingly.

> If a user has `SYSTEM` permissions they can delete the customer_product_history

```python
    url = 'http://smartapi.bboxx.co.uk/v1/customer_product_histories/1'
    headers = {'Content-Type': 'application/json', 'Authorization': 'Token token=' + <valid_token>}

    r = requests.delete(url=url, headers=headers)

    r
    >>> <Response 204>

    r.text
    >>>
```
> Note that the response from a 204 request is empty. This means that `r.json()` cannot be called and will throw a JSONDecodeError. In fact the response is `u''` - an empty unicode string.
